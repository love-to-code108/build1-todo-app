Ok so the reason i made this text file is to take notes that i feel like is useless or important :

Utils : Primary Building blocks or primary level functions that could be basically used anywhere and every where.
Lets take an example of an input function.
The only job of an input function is to take the input from the input box and return it. { that is a good example of an util function }



## My findings :
ok you know lets not go in depth with chakra lets just simply build and then later we chan do all the color and design related changes.

all i need to make sure is that whatever i am building right now is so simple that it can be easily changed later on.
